# RelayRides-Exercises

These are my solutions to RelayRides' [coding exercises](https://github.com/relayrides/coding-exercise).

## Frontend (Swift - Car Rental Search)

The application can be accessed in Xcode using the command `open -a Xcode RelayRides\ Exercises.xcworkspace` (the application must be opened using the xcworkspace file because of podfile dependencies)

## Backend (Python - Transaction Server)

The solution can be run using the command `python database.py`
